# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass, led by Liam, is a company seeking a system to improve driving test preparation by offering online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training. The system must support role-based access, reservation tracking, integration with the DMV for updates, and secure data management. It should also include user-friendly features like password recovery and customer progress tracking.

## What did you do particularly well?

I did well in understanding and capturing the business requirements clearly and aligning them with the system's goals. I ensured the requirements addressed both user needs and operational efficiency. In addition, I focused on including essential features like security, integration, and user-friendly design.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my activity diagram for scheduling a driving lesson, as it doesn't fully capture the system's logic and might cause confusion. I would improve it by adding more detailed state transitions and clarifying the flow of actions. This would make the diagram more accurate and easier to understand.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the requirements and translating them into clear, functional components of the system design. For example, I prioritized features like security and offline access to meet user expectations. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures the system is practical, user-friendly, and aligned with its intended purpose.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by breaking down user requirements into smaller components and creating diagrams or models to visualize the system. I focus on maintaining simplicity, scalability, and alignment with the user's goals. In the future, I’d use strategies like domain modeling, prototyping, and iterative feedback sessions to refine the system's design and functionality.
